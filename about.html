        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This project, titled "Space Experience," is a university-level basic project created purely for educational and recreational purposes. The goal of the project was to explore web development using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an immersive space-themed website experience.</p>
        
        <!-- Add extra margin to push this paragraph down, away from the glowing sun -->
        <p style="margin-top: 8rem;">The project involves dynamic backgrounds, drop-down navigation menus, and interactive elements that allow users to learn more about our solar system. From creating engaging backgrounds to designing user-friendly interfaces, this project has been a fun and insightful way to practice fundamental web development skills.</p>

        <p>The site features various planets from our solar system, and when users click on the "Explore the Space" dropdown, they can explore individual pages about each planet. Each page contains unique information and background videos related to the planets. The design is responsive, ensuring the website works across different devices.</p>

        <p>Overall, the project was an exciting way to practice essential web development skills, and it demonstrates the versatility of modern web technologies in creating both informative and visually compelling websites.</p>

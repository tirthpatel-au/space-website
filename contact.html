        <p style="margin-top: 10rem;">Out here, amidst the stars and planets, there are no phones, no signals, and certainly no service. You're in space completely free from the noise of emails and ringing phones. If you're trying to contact us, well... good luck! Here, you're on your own, floating in the endless expanse of the universe.</p>

        <p>But don't worryâ€”if you manage to send a cosmic signal, we'll somehow, somewhere, get back to you. Until then, enjoy the silence of space and keep exploring!</p>
